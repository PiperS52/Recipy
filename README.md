Filtering recipes

## Brief

This was a final project as part of Makers Academy. As a group we decided to design a food web app which would allow a
user to select a recipe according to what they had in their cupboard, while being able to listen to a cuisine-themed playlist for some inspiration while they cook.

## User Stories

```
As a user
Because I am obsessed with BBC
I would like to have access to all recipes from BBC Food

As a user
So that I can choose what to eat tonight
I would like to see a list of recipes with titles, images, summary, cook time

As a user
So that the page loads suitably quickly
I would like to be able to scroll infinitely

As a user
So that I can see all the recipe details
I would like to click on a recipe card and see a pop-up of all recipe details (ingredients, instructions etc.)

As a user
So that I can find recipes that use ingredients I have in the cupboard
I want to be able to filter recipes by ingredients

As a user
I can listen to music with my meal
I would like to have a link to a relaxing background music playlist from Spotify
```
